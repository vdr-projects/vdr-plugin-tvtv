VDR Plugin 'tvtv' Revision History
-----------------------------------

2008-11-11: Version 0.3.3p7
- Create a toggle to control adding of ongoing non-VPS timers ((thx to monty35)
  Note: if "off", this avoids a restart of a deleted running record/timer on
   next TVTV update

2008-10-28: Version 0.3.3p6
- Minor change to be compatible to 1.6.0
- Fix segfault after manual update
- The time shift bugfix is now extended, option "auto" detects current
  used timezone automatically and takes care (this covers daylight 
  saving time switches) (thx to monty35)
- Add option to define the format of the filename, Nature(Genre) and 
  Format can be included now (thx to monty35)
  Note: existing timers would not be updated after a change (needs to be
  impemented)!
- Add autofix of buggy received timezone offset (thx to monty35)
  TVTV transmit still +0200 for CET times (20081028)
- Do not readd outdated timers (thx to monty35)
  TVTV still transmit outdated timers, which otherwise would be added
   by plugin and shortly deleted by vdr

2007-02-06: Version 0.3.3
- The plugin needed to be restarted if username or password were changed
  since the "Packed String" (contains username and password) was only 
  generated once during start-up
- The time shift bugfix is now configurable via a new setup option
  solving problems with timers not using CET/CEST as timezone (e.g. BBC)
- In case a channel is not found in the tvtv_channelmap.conf file, the 
  channels name as well as its ID is printed in the logfile. This should
  help adding new channels to the config file.
- tvtv_channelmap.conf updated

2007-01-02: Version 0.3.2
- Code clean up
- Deleted timer object might cause VDR to be killed if timer is deleted
  within TVTV. (thx to monty35)

2006-10-23: Version 0.3.1
- added some #IFs making it compile on older VDR versions again.
- Code clean up
- tvtv_channelmap.conf updated
- "not confirmed" message removed from logfile by using an own routine
  to display OSD-Message
- TVTV bugfix now also works with VPS-Timers
- empty entry in config file may lead to segfault (thx to monty35 for
  reporting this one)

2006-10-09: Version 0.3.0
- new SVDRP command "UPDATE" to update TVTV timers.
- ChannelMap.h replaced by config file tvtv_channelmap.conf making it 
  easier to maintain. The format of the configfile is slightly different
  to the older ChannelMap.h now supporting different satellites and 
  countries. The channel map can be reloaded by the plugins setup menu.
- The new SVDRP command "RELOAD" reloads the channel map configuration
  file.
- Timer updates are rejected if shifted 1 or 2 hours earlier (depending
  on the current time zone). This behaviour can be controlled by a new 
  setup option.
- Replaced comparison of string::npos with "unsigned int" in routine
  ProcessImportedFile() since it may lead to problems on 64bit machines.


2006-09-25: Version 0.2.14
- i18n.c updated
- ChannelMap.h updated
- Timer updates are rejected if shifted 2 hours earlier. Successful and
  rejected updates are documented in the logfile (thx to monty35).

2006-04-25: Version 0.2.13a
- Function ShowName() in class cChannel is not available on VDR
  older than 1.3.15. Added an ifdef to solve this (thanks to GTRDRIVER
  for reporting this one)

2006-04-18: Version 0.2.13
- new setup option decides whether to use the description coming
  with the data from TVTV or not (just available for VDR 1.3.44+).
  Starting with VDR 1.3.44 timer description is only taken from 
  EPG so there is no need for the description from TVTV anymore.
- Added logging of downloaded data to /var/log/vdr_tvtv.log for
  debugging purpose (suggested by Schlappo)
- Station name of timer is now added to File Name of recording. 
  This behaviour can be controlled by a new setup option.
- Adapted Makefile due to new requirements of VDR 1.3.47+

2006-03-16: Version 0.2.12
- added basic support for VDR 1.3.44. Timer description coming
  from TVTV is now put into the Aux field of Timer-Object. Need
  to investigate how this works with recordings without EPG.
- Non-initialized data structure for HTTP download might cause
  VDR to be killed. Proper initialization should solve this.
- Missing define statements disabled VPS support in 0.2.11
- added BBC channels to ChannelMap.h

2006-02-17: Version 0.2.11
- split the source code into separate files making it easier to
  maintain.
- TVTV-Server can now be selected via OSD
- libcurl is now used to download data from TVTV adding proxy
  support to the plugin. 
- do not delete timers that are currently recording, even if it's 
  just updated.

  to compare values with different types (thx to bunghole)
