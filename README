Requirements:

  - VDR 1.2.0+ (VPS requires VDR 1.3.5+)
  - libcurl 7.10+
  - a valid tvtv subscription with "Linux PVR" as registered product


Description:

This plugin can be used to create timers from the job list of TVTVs website.
Unlike the job list on the website, only the most recent 32 timer jobs within
the upcoming 2 weeks are transfered by TVTV. Programs already on air cannot
be added to the timer list since they are not sent by TVTV.

  Format of File Name
      Select format of file name (Format/Nature/Title) in various
      combinations

  Use Station Name within File Name
      Nature and/or Station Name are added to the filename as separate
      directory.
      
  Use TVTV description in info.vdr
      Starting with VDR 1.3.44, the description of a recording is
      taken from EPG. This switch decides whether or not the description
      coming from TVTV will be added as a comment to info.vdr.

  Timer update time shift bugfix
      Sometimes a timer is wrongly updated due to a bug in the TVTV database. 
      It is shifted 1 hour (2 hours during daylight saving time) ealier. This can 
      be avoided by enabling this fix. "auto" is the recommended setting.

  TimeZone Shift BugFix
      Currently (Nov 2009), TVTV sends the wrong time zone for all times.
      This happen for CET regional timers like ARD and also for GMT timers like
      BBC.
      "auto" means that a buggy timezone is detected and fixed (Note: this only works if 
       *all* TVTV timers are in the same timezone as the vdr system. This is failsafe
       and should avoid problems on the next DST switch
      "manual" means that a timezone is manually corrected. This is NOT failsafe on the
       next DST switch!
      "manual (DST only)" use the manual timezone correction only in case of DST
      "manual (non-DST only)" use the manual timezone correction only in case of non-DST
      "ignore timezone" ignores the transmitted timezone completly

  Reload ChannelMap
      If channel map is changed it can be reloaded with this command


SVDRP Commands:

  shell scripts.
